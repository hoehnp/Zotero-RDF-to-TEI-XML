Stylesheet for converting Zotero RDF export XML to TEI XML bibliography
It is adapted, with many modifications and enhancements, from a stylesheet
developed by Kevin Hawkins and Stuart Yeats under terms of a Creative
Commons Attribution license: http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/ZoteroToTEI

Portions copyright Tom Elliott 2012. Free to copy, reuse, and remix under

TEI provides a range of rich options for bibliographic markup. Those chosen
for use here conform to the bibliographic markup practice of the 
Integrating Digital Papyrology project as reflected in bibliography
already online at http://papyri.info

Output for articles is not supported or expressed because the dataset for
which this stylesheet was adapted (a Zotero library of content associated
with the so-called Checklist of Greek and Latin Papyri etc.) was almost
entirely books.
